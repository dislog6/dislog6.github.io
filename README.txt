When using the website, you need to replace
some code including "C:\Users\daniel\Downloads\Evidence of Climate Change"
Evidence of Climate change/homepage.html" for example
with your own url for your computer (you need
to do this with all the html files since i am not
hosting this on an actual URL on the internet,
this is all local.)

====================================

enjoy!
